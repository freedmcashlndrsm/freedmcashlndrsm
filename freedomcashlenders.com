Cash-back auto loan refinancing allows you to borrow more than you owe on your current loan and receive the difference in cash.

The loan is secured by your car, and interest rates may be lower than other sources of cash, such as a credit card, payday loan or personal loan. Cash-out refinancing carries risks. Most notably, if you fall behind on the new loan, you could lose your car.
